## How to Run

### Setup Environment

1. **Install dependencies**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

2. **Database Integration (pgvector):** This application leverages pgvector for managing embeddings in a PostgreSQL database. pgvector allows the storage and querying of vector embeddings efficiently, making it an ideal choice for high-performance document analysis. For setting up and using pgvector in the system, follow the installation in the [PhiData documentation](https://docs.phidata.com/examples/integrations/pgvector) via **Docker**.

4. **Use the Interface**
- Enter API credentials
- Upload a legal document (PDF) in ```data/``` directory
- Add custom queries if needed
- View analysis results

4. Run the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

## Notes
- Uses **Phidata** for creating the agent
- Supports PDF documents only
- Uses **Ollama** to serve open-source models
- Uses **pgvector** as VectorDB
- Requires stable internet connection
- Requires OPENAI api key and usage costs apply
